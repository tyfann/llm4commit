"Improved GDScript editor with improved completion functionality"

Explanation:
The diff shows changes made to the GDScript editor and parser code to improve completion functionality. The `complete_code` function in `gd_editor.cpp` has been modified to include new logic for guessing expression types and adding completion options for objects. Additionally, the `_parse_expression` function in `gd_parser.cpp` has been updated to better handle expressions and reduce them to a simpler form. Finally, the `gd_parser.h` header file has been modified to add new completion methods. These changes should make the GDScript editor more powerful and useful for developers.

Semaphore: Fix interruptibility of acquiring and releasing locks.

Here's why this commit message is generated:

The commit message is generated based on the changes in the `semaphore.cc` file. The `co_lock_interruptible()` function has been modified to make it interruptible, which means that the function will stop executing when an interrupt signal is received. This change ensures that the semaphore can be acquired and released interruptibly, which is a more robust behavior. Additionally, the `unlock()` function has been modified to properly handle interrupts during the unlocking process.

"Fixes issue with incorrect show frame information in VP9 decoder"

Here is a summary of the changes made in this patch:

* The `GetCurrentFrame` method was modified to correctly save the last shown frame information when decoding multiple frames.
* The `next_next_frame` variable was added to store the next frame information and prevent it from being overwritten.
* The `next_frame` variable was modified to use the `next_next_frame` variable instead of directly accessing the `bit_stream` field.

"[AlgebraicSimplifier] Improved handling of padded shapes in HLO instructions"

Explanation:
The `AlgebraicSimplifier` visitor class has been modified to handle padded shapes more effectively. The `HandlePad` method now constructs a new `MakeSliceHlo` instruction instead of relying on the original `CopyLayoutBetweenShapes` call. This allows for better handling of negative padding and improved accuracy of the simplified layout. Additionally, the `UpdateLayout` method has been updated to take into account the new slice instruction. These changes improve the accuracy of the simplified layout and reduce the risk of incorrect results due to misaligned shapes.

"Reorganize `Get()` implementation to reduce overhead"

Here's the detailed explanation of each change:

1. "assert(pinnable_val!= nullptr);": This line asserts that `pinnable_val` is not null before accessing its members. It's added to prevent crashes when `pinnable_val` is null.
2. "PERF_TIMER_GUARD(get_snapshot_time);": This line adds a perf timer guard around the `Get()` function call to measure the time spent in this function.
3. "super_version-> mem-> Get(lkey,pinnable_val-> GetSelf(),& s,& merge_context,& range_del_agg,read_options)": This line retrieves the value from the memory table using the `Get()` method of the `super_version` object. The `GetSelf()` method is called on `pinnable_val` to get the handle for the pinned value.
4. "pinnable_val-> PinSelf();": This line pins the `pinnable_val` object to prevent it from being moved or copied.
5. "RecordTick(stats_,MEMTABLE_HIT);": This line records a tick in the `stats_` structure to indicate that a memory table hit occurred.
6. "RecordTick(stats_,MEMTABLE_MISS);": This line records a tick in the `stats_` structure to indicate that a memory table miss occurred.
7. "RecordTick(stats_,NUMBER_KEYS_READ);": This line records a tick in the `stats_` structure to indicate the number of keys read from the database.
8. "RecordTick(stats_,BYTES_READ,size);": This line records a tick in the `stats_` structure to indicate the number of bytes read from the database.
9. "MeasureTime(stats_,BYTES_PER_READ,size);": This line measures the time taken to read `size` bytes from the database.
10. "PERF_COUNTER_ADD(get_read_bytes,size);": This line increments the counter for the number of bytes read from the database.

These changes aim to optimize the performance of the `Get()` function

How to generate the commit message?

You can generate a commit message based on the output of `git diff` by using a template with placeholders for the relevant information. In this case, you can use the following template:
```
Diff between {file_name} versions: {diff_message}
```
In your case, you would replace `{file_name}` with the name of the file that was changed (`Hash.swift` in this case), and `{diff_message}` with the output of `git diff`. The resulting message would look like this:
```
Diff between Hash.swift versions: added validation tag and updated benchmark name.
```
This commit message provides a brief summary of the changes made in the file, including the addition of a new tag and an update to the benchmark name.

In this example, the `diff` command is used to compare two files, `xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/DVDCodecs/Video/DVDVideoCodecVDA.cpp` and `xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/DVDCodecs/Video/DVDVideoCodecVDA.cpp`, and the output shows the changes between the two files. The `diff` command generates a list of lines that are different between the two files, along with the line numbers and the file names.

The `git diff` command can also be used to compare multiple files or directories at once. For example, to compare all the files in the `xbmc/cores/dvdplayer` directory, you can use the following command:
```
git diff --cached --unified xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/*
```
This will show you the differences between all the files in the `xbmc/cores/dvdplayer` directory, including any changes made to multiple files at once.

You can also use the `--left-right` option to compare two files side by side, like this:
```
git diff --left-right xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/DVDCodecs/Video/DVDVideoCodecVDA.cpp xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/DVDCodecs/Video/DVDVideoCodecVDA.cpp.patch
```
This will show you the differences between the two files side by side, making it easier to see the changes.

Overall, the `git diff` command is a powerful tool for comparing files and identifying changes, and it can be useful for debugging issues or tracking down problems in your codebase.

The first line shows the file paths and the second line shows the differences between the two files.

The `TEST_CASE_TABLE_TYPE_FAILURE` macro is used to define a test case that fails when the table type is not supported by the WASM assembly. The `try` block is used to assemble the WASM code and create a new blockchain, while the `catch` block catches any exceptions that occur during the execution of the test.

The commit message suggests updating the `tests/api_tests/api_tests.cpp` file with one line added.

"Fixes #issue with SetInternalFlagsFromInteger for GprNode"
```
In this code diff, there are two changes:

1. In `SetInternalFlagsFromInteger`, the line `break;` has been added after the `if` statement. This means that the code will now always break out of the `if` statement instead of falling through to the next statement.
2. In the `else` clause of the `if` statement, a new line has been added that logs a debug message with the index of the GPR node. This is likely a bug fix to ensure that the correct GPR node is being used in the operation.

Based on these changes, I would suggest the following commit message:
```
commit message: Fixes #issue with SetInternalFlagsFromInteger for GprNode

The previous commit added a break statement after the `if` statement in `SetInternalFlagsFromInteger`, which causes the code to always break out of the `if` statement instead of falling through to the next statement. Additionally, a new line was added to log a debug message with the index of the GPR node in the `else` clause of the `if` statement. These changes fix an issue with using the incorrect GPR node in the operation.

"Improved lowering for typed JavaScript nodes"

Here is a summary of the changes in the code diff:

In `js-typed-lowering.cc`, the `JSTypedLowering` class has been modified to improve the lowering of typed JavaScript nodes. The `ReduceJSTypeOf` function now handles more types and produces more accurate results. Additionally, the `JSTypedLowering` constructor has been updated to use the `TypeCache` object instead of hardcoding the type cache.

In `js-typed-lowering.h`, the `JSTypedLowering` class has been modified to add new fields and methods to handle more types. Specifically, the `shifted_int32_ranges_` field has been added to store the shifted int32 ranges for each type, and the `the_hole_type_` field has been added to represent the hole type. The `ReduceJSTypeOf` function has also been modified to handle more types and produce more accurate results.

In `types.h`, the `V` macros have been updated to include new types and remove unused types. Specifically, the `Unique` macro has been updated to include new types such as `kReceiver` and `kSymbol`, while the `NonStringUniqueOrHole` macro has been removed since it is no longer used.

These checks are used to determine whether to use the default indexer or to create a new indexer for the specific type.

* The `response` variable has been updated to include the `Content` property, which contains the response content from the HTTP request.
* The `ParseResponse` method has been added to extract the release information from the response content.

 Improved RazorCompilationService with bug fixes and performance improvements.
```

The changes in the `RazorCompilationService` class between the two versions are:

1. In the first version (`a`), the `CreateCodeDocument` method has been modified to normalize line endings when reading the source code from a stream. This change ensures that the same line ending conventions are used across different platforms and environments.
2. In the second version (`b`), the `ProcessCodeDocument` method has been added to the `RazorCompilationService` class. This method processes the compiled code using an instance of the `RazorEngine` class, which improves performance by avoiding unnecessary reparsing of the code.
3. In both versions, the `CreateCodeDocument` method has been protected, indicating that it should only be overridden by subclasses.
4. The `TestRazorCompilationService` class in the test project (`b`) includes a modified version of the `CreateCodeDocument` method that normalizes line endings for testing purposes.

Based on these changes, the commit message could be:

`Improved RazorCompilationService with bug fixes and performance improvements. Normalized line endings for consistent behavior across platforms, and added ProcessCodeDocument method for improved performance.`

commit message: Update SparkleFetcherGit with encrypted password storage.

Here are some possible changes you could make to improve the security of this code:

1. Use a secure salt value: The `password_salt` variable is used to generate a unique salt value for each password. However, the current implementation uses a hardcoded value that may be vulnerable to attacks. Consider using a secure random number generator to generate a stronger salt value.
2. Use a more secure encryption algorithm: The current implementation uses the OpenSSL `enc-d-aes-256-cbc-base64` algorithm, which is considered to be relatively insecure. Consider using a more modern and secure encryption algorithm, such as `enc-a-aes-256-cbc-base64` or `enc-a-chacha20-poly1305`.
3. Use a separate encryption key for each password: Currently, the same encryption key is used for both the smudged and cleaned passwords. This means that if an attacker obtains the encryption key, they will be able to access all of the encrypted passwords. Consider using a separate encryption key for each password to provide better protection against attacks.
4. Implement proper error handling: The current implementation does not handle errors well, and can lead to unexpected behavior if there are any issues during the encryption process. Consider implementing proper error handling to ensure that the code can recover gracefully from any issues.
5. Use a secure storage mechanism for the encryption keys: Currently, the encryption keys are stored in plain text in the Git repository. This is a significant security risk, as the encryption keys can be easily accessed by anyone who has access to the repository. Consider using a secure storage mechanism, such as a hardware security module (HSM) or a secure key store, to protect the encryption keys.

"Update TimingControlPoint to use default beat length for new instances (#784)"

Here is a breakdown of the changes made in each file:

* `osu.Game/Beatmaps/ControlPoints/TimingControlPoint.cs`: In this file, we added a new constant `DEFAULT_BEAT_LENGTH` and updated the `beatLength` property to use this value by default for new instances of the `TimingControlPoint` class.
* `osu.Game/Beatmaps/Formats/LegacyDifficultyCalculatorBeatmapDecoder.cs`: In this file, we created a new class called `LegacyDifficultyCalculatorControlPoint` that inherits from `TimingControlPoint`. This new class has the same properties as `TimingControlPoint`, but with the default beat length set to `1000`.
* `osu.Game/Rulesets/Timing/MultiplierControlPoint.cs`: In this file, we updated the `BaseBeatLength` property to use the default beat length for new instances of the `MultiplierControlPoint` class.
* `osu.Game/Rulesets/UI/Scrolling/DrawableScrollingRuleset.cs`: In this file, we updated the `load()` method to use the default beat length for new instances of the `DrawableScrollingRuleset` class.

These changes are related to updating the default beat length used by various classes in the Osu! game engine.

index: 2493

Enhance diagnostics hook to support resource namespace with dot notation

Here are the changes made in the file:

* The `Enable` method now takes an additional `IPi` parameter, which is used to generate the resource namespace.
* The `resourceNamespace` variable has been updated to include the `IPi` parameter in the calculation.
* The `path` variable is now optional and can be null if the request URL does not contain the resource prefix.
* The `resourceNamespace` variable is now calculated differently, using the `Path.GetDirectoryName` method to get the directory name of the request URL, and then appending the resource prefix and the directory name using concatenation.

These changes are intended to improve the performance and accuracy of the diagnostics hook by reducing the number of unnecessary requests made to the application. By using the `IPi` parameter to generate the resource namespace, the hook can now handle resources with dot notation more effectively.

 Changes to thread pool heuristics for better performance.

Here are some key changes:

* Introduced `monitor_heuristic` function to determine the number of threads to create or kill based on the current state of the thread pool.
* Modified the heuristic algorithm to take into account the number of iterations completed by each thread.
* Added new variables `nthreads_diff` and `num_waiting_iterations` to track these values.
* Changed the behavior of the `monitor_state` switch statement to handle cases more appropriately.
* Added new lines to the `mono_thread_pool_init` function to initialize the `wsqs` array and start a new thread for the asynchronous invocation.
* Made minor changes to the `mono_thread_create_internal` function to ensure that the correct stack size is used.
* Added a new line to the `async_invoke_thread` function to call the `tp_finish_func` function when appropriate.

These changes aim to improve the performance of the thread pool by making more informed decisions about the number of threads to create or kill based on the current workload.

Diff between mono/metadata/object.c and mono/metadata/object.c
Added a new method to get the value of a field as an object

Here's a summary of the changes made in the patch:

The patch adds a new method `mono_field_get_value_object` that takes a `MonoDomain`, `MonoClassField`, and `MonoObject` as parameters. The method returns a `MonoObject` containing the value of the field as an object. The method first checks the field type and raises an exception if it's not handled. Then, it determines whether the field is static or not, and whether it's a literal or not. Finally, it returns a `MonoObject` containing the value of the field as an object.

 Changes in exceptions.cs and interp related files for overflow handling.
```
This commit message is generated based on the changes in the `exceptions.cs` file and some related files in the `interp` directory. The changes are related to overflow handling for checked casts. Specifically, the `test_4_checked_cast()` method in `exceptions.cs` now throws an `OverflowException` instead of returning 3. Additionally, the `mono_get_exception_overflow()` function has been added to the `mintops.def` file to handle overflows in converted methods. Finally, the `transform.c` file has been modified to include new code to handle overflows in the stack type I8.

Here is a summary of the changes made in this commit:

* The `ProcessContentItemsAsync` method was modified to check if the `IndexingTaskTypes.Update` flag is set before processing the content item.
* If the flag is set, the method checks if the content item exists and updates the document in the Lucene index with the new content type.
* The `BuildIndexContext` class was modified to include the `lastIndexId` property, which is used to determine whether the document needs to be updated.

commit message: Fixes #1, adds #2, resolves #3

Here are the changes between the two files:

File1: src/libraries/clean.cmd
------------------------------

    setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion
    echo Stop VBCSCompiler.exe execution.for/f"tokens=2 delims=,"%%F in(' tasklist/nh/fi"imagename eq VBCSCompiler.exe "/fo csv') do taskkill/f/PID%%~F

    echo Cleaning entire working directory...call git clean-xdf
    exit/b!ERRORLEVEL!diff --git a/src/libraries/clean.sh  b/src/libraries/clean.sh
    fi

The differences are mostly due to the file extension change from.cmd to.sh, but there are also some syntax changes and additional lines added to the File2 version.

 Changed how beatmap set header displays download buttons to only show when there are download options available.

Here's a breakdown of the changes made in this commit:

1. The `DownloadButtonsVisible` property has been added to the `Header` class. This property indicates whether any download options are available for the current beatmap set.
2. The `RulesetSelector` and `Picker` fields have been added to the `Header` class. These fields represent the ruleset selector and picker components, respectively.
3. The `load` method has been updated to cache the `RulesetSelector.Current` value. This ensures that the selected ruleset is always available for use by the picker component.
4. The `BackgroundDependencyLoader` has been updated to include the `load` method. This method is responsible for loading the necessary dependencies for the `Header` class.
5. The `BeatmapSet.BindValueChanged` event handler has been added to the `Header` class. This event handler is triggered whenever the `BeatmapSet` property changes, and it updates the `Picker.BeatmapSet` and `RulesetSelector.BeatmapSet` properties accordingly.
6. The `cover.BeatmapSet` property has been added to the `Header` class. This property represents the beatmap set being displayed in the cover art.
7. The `setInfo.NewValue` variable has been added to the `load` method. This variable represents the new value of the `BeatmapSet` property, which is used to update the `Picker.BeatmapSet`, `RulesetSelector.BeatmapSet`, and `cover.BeatmapSet` properties.
8. The `if` statement has been added to the `load` method. This statement checks whether the `setInfo.NewValue` is null, and if so, it does not update the `Picker.BeatmapSet`, `RulesetSelector.BeatmapSet`, or `cover.BeatmapSet` properties.

In summary, this commit adds new fields and methods to the `Header` class to improve its functionality and ensure that the beatmap set display is accurate and up-to-date.

Diff in coreclr/src/jit/flowgraph.cpp: Improved handling of throw expressions with better error messages

The changes in the diff are related to improving the handling of throw expressions in the FlowGraph module of the CoreCLR JIT compiler.

commit message: Update ShareX Helpers Lib with new DebugForm and DebugLog

The changes in the `DebugForm` class are:

* Added a private static `instance` field to store the single instance of `DebugForm`.
* Changed the constructor to take a `Logger` parameter and set it as the `Logger` property.
* Added a `FormClosing` event handler to log messages when the form is closing.
* Changed the `GetFormInstance` method to check for the existence of an existing instance and create a new one if necessary.

The changes in the `MainForm` class are:

* Added a click event handler for the `tsbImageHistory` button to open the `DebugForm`.
* Changed the `tsmiTestImageUpload` button's click event handler to open the `DebugForm` instead.

These changes are intended to improve the functionality of the `DebugForm` and make it easier to use by adding a single instance of the form and providing a convenient way to open it from other forms in the application.

Difficulty level: Easy

In this challenge, you will analyze the differences between two versions of a Python file using `git diff`. Based on your analysis, you will write a commit message that summarizes the changes made in the file.

Here are the instructions:

1. Open the Python file `backend_pdf.py` in your favorite text editor or IDE.
2. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `git diff backend_pdf.py`. This will generate a diff output that shows the changes between the current version of the file and the previous version.
3. Analyze the diff output and identify the changes made in the file. You can use the `git diff` output as a starting point for writing a commit message.
4. Write a commit message that summarizes the changes made in the file. Your message should be concise and informative, and it should include the relevant information from the diff output.
5. Save your modified file and commit it to your Git repository with the updated commit message.

Good luck!

index: 3096


Commit Message: Changed idle.py to use new `linecache_checkcache` function and modified modulator.py to check for valid C identifiers.

Explanation:
The diff output shows changes made to two files: idle.py and modulator.py. In idle.py, the `linecache_checkcache` function has been added, which checks if the cache is already computed for a given line before recomputing it. In modulator.py, the `checkid` function has been modified to check if a given string is a valid C identifier by checking if it starts with an letter or digit, and then iterating over each character in the string to check if it is also a letter or digit. These changes are intended to improve the performance of the idle shell and ensure that identifiers are correctly checked in the modulator.

`Improved error handling for scoring methods in scikit-learn (#2785)`

Here is a summary of the changes made in the patch:

* Improved error handling for scoring methods in scikit-learn by adding more specific error messages for different cases.
* Added a new `check_scoring` function to validate that the estimator passed has a `fit` or `predict` method, and if so, use the appropriate scorer.
* Changed the default behavior of `make_scorer` to return `None` if no scoring is specified, instead of raising an error.
* Made the `make_scorer` function more flexible by allowing it to take a `greater_is_better` parameter and a `needs_proba` parameter.

"Improve performance of numpy.array() by optimizing memory allocation for non-unicode arrays."

Here are some potential changes that could be made to improve the performance of the `numpy.array()` function:

1. Use a more efficient memory allocation strategy for non-unicode arrays. Currently, the function allocates memory for each element separately, which can lead to inefficiencies when dealing with large arrays.
2. Optimize the memory allocation for non-unicode arrays by using a single block of memory to store all elements. This can reduce the number of memory allocations and improve performance.
3. Avoid using PyArray_NewFromDescr() whenever possible, as it involves creating a new array object and copying the data, which can be expensive. Instead, use PyArray_New() with the correct type code and item size.
4. Implement a cache for the most common types and sizes to avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
5. Consider using a different data structure, such as a vector or list, instead of an array for small datasets. This can eliminate the need for memory allocations altogether.

"Updates to gather subscriptions: fixed typos and improved performance."
```
In this code diff, there are several changes made to the `gather_subscriptions` function in the `zephyr` library. The main changes are:

1. Fixing typos: There are several places in the code where typos were corrected, such as `with_color` changed to `with_color`, `subs` changed to `subs`, and `stream_hash` changed to `stream_hash`.
2. Improved performance: The function now uses `select_related()` instead of `prefetch_related()` to improve performance. This means that the database queries are more efficient and can handle larger datasets.
3. Added new variables: Two new variables, `stream_hash` and `stream_name`, were added to the function. `stream_hash` is a dictionary that maps each stream ID to its name and invite-only status, while `stream_name` is a variable that holds the name of the stream for each subscription.
4. Changed logic for handling subscriptions: The logic for handling subscriptions has been improved to better handle cases where a user has multiple subscriptions to the same stream. The function now uses `get_display_recipient()` to get the display name of each recipient, rather than relying on the `recipient` attribute directly.
5. Refactored code for readability: The code has been refactored for readability, with functions and variables renamed for clarity. For example, the `with_color` variable was renamed to `with_color_subscriptions`, and the `no_color` variable was renamed to `no_color_subscriptions`.

Based on these changes, the commit message could be: "Updates to gather subscriptions: fixed typos and improved performance, with new variables and refactored code for readability."

Modified SQS listener to extract external port from HTTP headers for better error handling

Comparing the two files, the changes are minor and related to improving error handling in the SQS listener. The `format_list_dl_source_queues_response` function has been modified to extract the external port used by the client to make the request, which can help identify issues when the `Host` header is missing or invalid. Additionally, the `get_docker_container_names` function has been modified to use `run` instead of `subprocess` to improve reliability. These changes should result in more accurate and informative error messages when issues arise.

"RobotsTxtMiddleware: fix regression in error handling"

Explanation:
The `diff` command shows that there are changes between the two files. In the `robotstxt.py` file, there is a new function `_robots_error()` that is called when an error occurs while parsing robots.txt files. The function removes the parser for the netloc from the dictionary and calls the `callback()` method of the deferred promise.

In the `test_downloadermiddleware_robotstxt.py` file, there is a change to the `test_robotstxt_immediate_error()` function. The function now includes an additional argument `err`, which is set to an instance of `error.DNSLookupError()` when an error occurs during DNS lookups.

Based on these changes, the commit message could be "RobotsTxtMiddleware: fix regression in error handling".

* The `fill_method` parameter has been added to the function to specify how missing values should be filled.
* The `left_by` parameter has been updated to use the `group` key instead of the `key` key for merging DataFrames with missing values.

Added support for path parameters in `get_dependent()` function (#1234)

Here is a summary of the changes made in the code diff:

* Added a new parameter `path` to the `get_dependent()` function to support path parameters.
* Changed the type of the `path` parameter to `str` or `Callable`.

The `path` parameter is now of type `str` or `Callable`, and we added a check to ensure that it's of one of the supported types. Additionally, we modified the error message for when the `path` parameter is not of a supported type.

Changing how IPython handles bad configuration during initialization

Here is a summary of the changes made by this commit:
The commit modifies the way IPython handles bad configuration during initialization by adding a new error handling mechanism that prints the application description, help, and examples when a bad configuration is detected. The `catch_config_error()` function is added to catch TraitError and ArgumentError exceptions raised during configuration and print the corresponding messages. Additionally, the `print_help()` and `print_description()` functions are modified to include more information about available configurables and examples. Finally, the `parse_command_line()` function is updated to handle the `--help-all` flag correctly.

Comparing core/server/data/validation/index.js and core/server/models/index.js...

Modified lines in validation/index.js:

* `availableThemes=Promise.resolve(config.paths.availableThemes);` replaced with `availableThemes=requireTree(config.paths.themePath);`
* `if (!availableThemes)` removed
* `return availableThemes.then(function(themes))` replaced with `return availableThemes.then(function(themes)...`

Modified lines in models/index.js:

* `models={ self.Base=require('./base');...` replaced with `models={...`
* `readdirAsync=Promise.promisify(fs.readdir),...` replaced with `readdirAsync=Promise.promisify(fs.readdir),...`
* `lstatAsync=Promise.promisify(fs.lstat),...` replaced with `lstatAsync=Promise.promisify(fs.lstat),...`
* `readlinkAsync=Promise.promisify(fs.readlink),...` replaced with `readlinkAsync=Promise.promisify(fs.readlink),...`

The changes made in both files are related to the `availableThemes` variable and the `readdir`, `lstat`, and `readlink` functions. These changes seem to be aimed at improving the performance of the validation process by using Promises instead of callbacks, and at making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

"Update FocusContext to prevent double blurring"

Here are some possible changes you could make to the code to address the issue:

1. Add a `once` method to the `FocusContext` class that will only call the `blur` method once per object, even if it's called multiple times. For example:
```
class FocusContext extends Model
  @once: ->
    # blur logic goes here
```
2. Modify the `blur` method in `Focusable` to check if the `FocusContext` has already been blurred for this object before calling the `blur` method. For example:
```
class Focusable extends Mixin
  focus: ->
    # focus logic goes here

  blur: ->
    # blur logic goes here
    unless @focusContext.blurred(@)
      # call blur method only once per object
```
3. Implement a `blurSuppression` counter in the `FocusContext` class that keeps track of how many times the `blur` method has been called for a given object. When the counter reaches a certain value (e.g. 5), the `blur` method will be disabled for that object. For example:
```
class FocusContext extends Model
  blurSuppressionCounter: 0

  blur: ->
    # blur logic goes here
    unless @blurSuppressionCounter > 4
      # call blur method only once per object
      @blurSuppressionCounter += 1
```
These are just a few ideas for how you could address the issue of double blurring in your application. The best approach will depend on your specific use case and requirements.

* The `printWasted` function now uses the improved `getMeasurementsSummaryMap` function to generate a table with more informative labels for each measurement.
* The `printWasted` function also logs the total time spent by the component, along with the number of instances and the wasted time.

The patch improves the performance analysis of React components by providing a more comprehensive and accurate view of their performance.

commit message: Update release version with new build branch.

The `get-release-version` script in the current repository updates the `IsReleaseBranch` variable based on the value of `BUILD_SOURCEBRANCHNAME`, which is set by the `vsts-task` tool. The script also checks if the branch name includes the string `- releases` or if it starts with `electron-`, and sets the `IsSignedZipBranch` variable accordingly. Finally, the script logs the updated `IsReleaseBranch` variable to the console using the `vso[task.setvariable]` command.

Here are the changes made by the patch:

* Added a new `const` declaration for `isReleaseBranch` inside the `getReleaseVersion` function.
* Changed the condition for setting `isReleaseBranch` to use `buildBranch.match()` instead of `process.env.IS_RELEASE_BRANCH`.
* Added a new `const` declaration for `isSignedZipBranch` inside the `getReleaseVersion` function.
* Changed the condition for setting `isSignedZipBranch` to use `buildBranch.startsWith()` instead of `process.env.IS_SIGNED_ZIP_BRANCH`.
* Logs the updated `IsReleaseBranch` variable to the console using the `vso[task.setvariable]` command instead of logging it directly to the console.

These changes are intended to improve the accuracy of the release version calculation and ensure that the correct branch is identified as the release branch.

Diff in UrlCodeHints/main.js: Removed unnecessary deferred object and resolved promise synchronously

The above diff shows that there are changes made to the `UrlCodeHints` module. Specifically, there are two changes:

1. The `deferred` object is removed in the `if` statement, indicating that the result of the asynchronous call is now being stored in the `cachedHints` object directly instead of being deferred.
2. In the `else` clause, the `if` statement checks if the `deferred` object exists and is not already resolved or rejected. If it does exist and is in a pending state, it is rejected to ensure that the promise is always resolved or rejected synchronously.

Based on these changes, the commit message could be:

"Fixed issue with asynchronous calls returning incorrect results by removing unnecessary deferred object and resolving promise synchronously."
index: 4757

"Custom Actions updated with new action name and options in Satan.js"

Here are some key changes that can be inferred from the diff output:

1. Addition of a new action name and options in `CustomActions` in `lib/Interactor/RemoteActions/CustomActions.js`.
2. Update of the `Satan.remoteWrapper` function in `lib/Satan.js` to include the new action name and options.
3. Configuration of the `axm_actions` array in `God.clusters_db` for the new action.
4. Removal of an unused variable in `Satan.js`.
5. Update of the `event` variable in `Satan.remoteWrapper` to include the new action name and options.

Based on these changes, here is a possible commit message:

"Update Custom Actions in Interactor/RemoteActions/CustomActions.js with new action name and options. Also, update Satan.js to include the new action name and options in the remote wrapper function."

"React C++ Bridge: Improved invokeAsync performance with runtime executor"

Explanation:
The diff shows changes made to two files in the React C++ Bridge repository. The first file, `RCTCxxBridge.mm`, contains a new implementation of `invokeAsync` that uses a `RuntimeExecutor` to execute the callback function asynchronously. This change improves the performance of `invokeAsync` by avoiding the overhead of running the callback function on the main thread.

The second file, `RCTSurfacePresenter.mm`, adds a new method `invokeAsync` that takes a callback function and executes it on the `messageQueueThread`. This change allows for more efficient handling of asynchronous operations in the `RCTSurfacePresenter` class.

Overall, these changes improve the performance of the React C++ Bridge by reducing the overhead of executing callback functions and allowing for more efficient handling of asynchronous operations.

"[squash] Merge pull request #12345: Improve selftest.js by following best practices for code organization and readability."

How do I generate the commit message?

Answer:

To generate a commit message based on the Git diff output, you can use the following template:
```
[squash] Merge pull request #<number of pull request>: <commit message>
```
In your case, the commit message would be:
```
[squash] Merge pull request #12345: Improve selftest.js by following best practices for code organization and readability.
```
You can replace `<number of pull request>` with the actual number of the pull request that you want to merge.

"Improved JavaScript Code Hints with Ternary Expressions"

In this commit message, we've added a new feature that improves the JavaScript code hints provided by Visual Studio Code. Specifically, we've added support for ternary expressions, which allow developers to more easily navigate and understand their code. This feature was implemented by adding a new worker script called `tern-worker.js` that imports the `require.js` module and uses it to load the `thirdparty/tern-worker.min.js` file. We've also updated the `getJumptoDef` function in the `JavaScriptCodeHints` module to include the new ternary expression functionality. Finally, we've added some new strings to the `nls/root/strings.js` file to support the new command "Jump to Definition".
